# REU on creating a compute analysis cluster from Raspberry PIs

Gregor von Laszewski, laszewski@gmail.com

## Abstract

TBD

## Introduction


## Setting up a Cluster with Raspbian

### cm-pi-burn

describe high level what it does nad how we use it

### Alternatives to cm-pi-burn

PXE booting. we will focus first on cmpi burn

## Setting up Kubernetes on the Cluster

## Example use of the Kubernetes Cluster

## Benchmark

## Conclusion


## Tasks

* send info to Gregor
* get in payrol to get payed
* take building seminar for after hour access
* get familiar with sdcard burn from a pi, you may have to burn one on your laptop first, remember to change passwd before setting it on network
* get familiar with cm-pi-brn
* read Subs report
* make sure to use branches when working on the code. 

* start building a cluster

### Hardware

* get spacers (which size?)
* make small inventory count, PI3 and Pi3B+
* we will get new network switch and PI4 for masters
* figure out if we need anything else
